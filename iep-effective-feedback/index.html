      <google-codelab-step label="Reviewing the Big 3 Feedback Questions" duration="0">
        <p>Effective teaching not only involves imparting information and understandings to students (or providing constructive tasks, environments, and learning) but also involves <strong>assessing and evaluating students&#39; understanding of this information</strong>, so that the next teaching act can be matched to the present understanding of the students. This first part, assessing and evaluating, is what you practiced doing during the DFS session.</p>
<p>This &#34;second part&#34; is the feedback part, and it relates to the three major questions: </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\d27bbffe77519704.png"></p>
<p>These three questions address the dimensions of <strong>feed up, feed back, and feed forward. </strong>An ideal learning environment or experience occurs when <strong>both teachers and students seek answers to each of these questions. </strong><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~mvp19/ETF/Feedback.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Hattie and Timperley, 2007</em></a></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Introduction to The Four Step Feedback Model" duration="0">
        <p>To develop the kind of feedback that will effectively bridge the gap between students&#39; current levels of understanding, we will follow a four step process: </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\9e4b6595697306a8.png"></p>
<p>You will need your Data &amp; Feedback from the DFS session for either Haley or Justin as well as their IEP At a Glance. Electronic copies of the IEP At a Glances can be <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nsn6x4ZS_f1xj4UcqUWO4qUC6Xne7Xez?usp=sharing" target="_blank">found here</a>. If you would like, you can transfer your learning from the DFS session into the Providing Effective Feedback Organizer, or just use the sections available to craft your feedback. </p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Step 1: Describe a Strength" duration="0">
        <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\814b478943da3d12.png"></p>
<p>Describing a specific strength or area of growth reinforces student learning and supports the development of a growth mindset. The most helpful way to describe a strength is to <strong>name a concrete, specific positive, emphasizing description over personal approval. </strong>For example, saying &#34;Good job!&#34; doesn&#39;t give the student enough information to know what they&#39;re doing well. Think back to our opening activity with the origami cup. While it might have made the student feel somewhat better to hear the teacher say &#34;Good job,&#34; the student was no closer to being able to achieve the learning target. By being more concrete and specific, e.g. &#34;Angel, I notice that you have written almost two full pages. I know you have been working hard on your writing stamina, and can see how much you have progressed.&#34;  </p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Using the IEP At a Glance</strong></h3>
<p>When describing a strength, it is important to do so in a way that supports individual needs. The IEP At a Glance may give you more information on current areas of strength for the student, as well as areas in which they have previously needed more support. </p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Solidify your Learning</strong></p>
<p>Return to the information you gathered about Haley or Justin&#39;s learning from the DFS session, and review their IEP At a Glance. In your Providing Effective Feedback Organizer, practice describing a specific strength for Haley or Justin. </p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\f5393587fe9d74e4.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Step 2: Clarify the Learning Target (Where am I going)" duration="0">
        <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\cd65e3519b1f9eef.png"></p>
<p>In this step, you are aiming to remind and/or clarify for the student what the learning target is and what success will look like. Students need to know where they are going in order to get there. During our opening activity, understanding that the learning target was to make an origami cup made the task much more understandable. When Megan&#39;s mom understood where she was supposed to go (Manhattan, not Brooklyn) she could pay attention to making sure she was passing the right landmarks along the way. </p>
<p>This is the same for students in our classes, especially those with diverse learning needs who may not have internalized the learning target due to various learning barriers. Clarifying the learning target helps students to know where they are going, making the expected outcome clear and communicating to them what reaching that target will look like.  For example, you may say or write, &#34;Your learning target for this lesson is to find three quotes from the text to support your argument.&#34;</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Solidify your Learning</strong></p>
<p>In your Providing Effective Feedback Organizer, practice clarifying the learning target from the math or ELA task. </p>
</aside>

      <google-codelab-step label="Step 3: Provide Information about Progress (how am I going)" duration="0">
        <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\e6a486152caf65bc.png"></p>
<p>The third step is critical for helping students to understand how they are progressing, or how they are &#34;going&#34; along their learning journey. For this part, you will want to focus specifically on the information you have learned either from the DFS protocol, or from your on-the-spot/formative assessment strategies you use during class. To provide information on how the student is progressing, you will want to be explicit about what it seems they may know, and what they may have confused or misunderstand. For example, based on the information I learned about Angel&#39;s possible misunderstandings or difficulties with grasping the underlying concept, I might write, &#34;Angel, it seems like you&#39;re using quotes from the text, but the quotes aren&#39;t providing evidence to support your argument.&#34; Think about what the feedback could have been for Megan&#39;s mom when she was not progressing towards the correct address: &#34;Megan&#39;s mom, I see that you&#39;re driving on a road and looking for landmarks, but it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ve passed Yankee Stadium or the Bronx Zoo, which are on the way to Manhattan.&#34;  </p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Using the IEP At a Glance</strong></h3>
<p>As part of this step, you are relying on information you gathered during the DFS protocol, which included using the IEP At a Glance to better understand student learning barriers. Before crafting your feedback in this step, you may want to review the IEP At a Glance again to make sure you&#39;re taking into account student learning needs. </p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Solidify your Learning</strong></p>
<p>In the third column of your Organizer, provide written feedback for Haley or Justin related to their progress toward the learning target. Consider your language choice- are you writing it in a way that your student will understand? </p>

<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\d31726e0ffcdf513.png"></p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Turn, Talk &amp; Reflect: </strong></h3>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 159.93px" src="img\247c4974978fee46.png"></p>
<p>Turn to someone near you and share your responses to steps 1-3. Together, discuss your approach, ask one another questions, and refine your feedback if necessary. Self-Directed learners, if no one around you is ready to discuss, your Table Facilitator will gladly speak with you. </p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Step 4: Offer Actionable Next Step (where to next?)" duration="0">
        <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\ef465b516a70205d.png"></p>
<p>In this last step, you want to make a precise suggestion that will help move the student&#39;s learning forward. By examining where to go next, students can better self-regulate their learning, gain instructional strategies, better identify what they do and do not yet understand, and deepen their understanding. As we learn from Hattie and Timperley, &#34;Instruction often is sequential, with teachers providing information, tasks, or learning intentions; students attempting tasks; and some subsequent consequence. <strong>Too often, the consequence is more information, more tasks, and more expectations;</strong> students thus learn that the answer to <strong>&#34;Where to next?&#34; is &#34;more.&#34;</strong> The power of feedback, however, can be used to specifically address this question by <strong>providing information that leads to greater possibilities for learning</strong>. These may include enhanced challenges, more self-regulation over the learning process, greater fluency and automaticity, more strategies and processes to work on the tasks, deeper understanding, and more information about what is and what is not understood. This <strong>feed forward </strong>question can have some of the <strong>most powerful impacts on learning.</strong>&#34; For example, in Angel&#39;s case I might provide him with a next step that includes an opportunity for him to better understand his learning, such as, &#34;Try going back to through the text, find the section where you learned about speech leading to harm, and put a sticky note on the page so you can return to it easily. Re-read that section to find the sentences that best support your reason, and use those in place of the quote you have now<strong>. </strong>You can do the same process for your other two reasons.&#34;</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Using the IEP At a Glance</strong></h3>
<p>For students with diverse learning needs, the way in which you help students answer the question &#34;where to next?&#34; is particularly important. The IEP At a Glance may provide you with useful information about how the individual student learns best. Supporting their growth by employing these strategies, and explicitly teaching students about how these strategies support their learning, is critical to developing mastery. </p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Solidify your Learning</strong></p>
<p>In the fourth column of your Organizer, provide Haley or Justin with a precise suggestion to bridge the gap between their current levels of understanding and their learning goals in order to move their learning forward. </p>

<p>Step 4 is hard but incredibly important. Working in groups of 2-3, workshop your feedback, considering how to help one another make it more precise and actionable, as well as not just adding &#34;more&#34; as Hattie and Timperley caution against. </p>
